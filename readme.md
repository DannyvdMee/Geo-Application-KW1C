# KW1C Group Project P8

### Description
This repository will hold the code and documents that we made for KW1C <br>
The application will be about a geo walk route for the students to walk on the first school day. <br>
POI will be created with exercises combined to them. Some POI are only visible within 50m <br>
A department of the school get it's own URL ([departmentname].geowalk.nl) <br>
Teachers will be able to create a route by adding POI to an empty map <br>
After saving a route UUID will be created, students can then walk the route by searching for the UUID given by the teacher <br>
Also can students be added to groups. <br>
All of the anwsers the students are giving at each exersise are pushed to a overview table in which the teacher can see the answers divided by group and question. <br>

The old project code will be completely rewritten by the end of the project.
