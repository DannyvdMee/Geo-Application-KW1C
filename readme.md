# KW1C Group Project P8

### Description
This repository will hold the code and documents that we made for KW1C <br>
As far as we know it will be a updated application for the first schoolday. <br>
Teachers will be able to create a route, the students can then add a route by searching for it by its route ID. <br>
Our goal is to complete rewrite the existing code, so it will be more readable and more up-to-date. <br>
Further information will be available later this week, I will update as soon as possible
